# Timetable

This is a Google Chrome extension that reads the content of pages, scanning for dates and times for any special events and occasions. With all the things going on in people's lives, it can be difficult to keep track of all the opportunities that come in one's path. This extension looks for such opportunities and offers users the option to add the event to their calendar, or to remind them about it later.
